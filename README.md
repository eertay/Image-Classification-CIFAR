# Image Classification using the CIFAR-10 Dataset

This is a project seeking to classify images from the aforementioned dataset using two machine learning algorithms: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). The accuracies of both models are outputted at the end of the project.

Keras and PyTorch libraries are used to improve accuracies.
